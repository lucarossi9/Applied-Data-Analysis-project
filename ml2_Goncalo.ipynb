    "\n",
    "In this project, we are going to analyze a data set of quotes from New York Times in order to cluster the authors of the quotes by common opinions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Oftentimes, we would like to know someone's opinion about a certain missing topic. In that case, if we have a cluster  made  of people with similar opinions in a variety of topics, we can try to infer their opinion on the missing topic based on the opinion of the majority of his/her cluster.THis is a process similar to the KKN algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set is presented as an aggregated set of unique quotations with the most likely speaker. Each unique quotation occurs only once in this version of the data and the probabilities of the candidate speakers to which the quotation can be attributed are aggregated over all occurrences of the quotation. This version of the data is a minimal - but complete - list of attributed quotations that is aimed at users who only require quotation-speaker attributions, but no individual contexts for these quotations from the original articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The data\n",
    "\n",
    "We are provided with a compressed `.bz2` json file containing one row per quote. \n",
    "The `.json` has the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `quoteID`: Primary key of the quotation (format: \"YYYY-MM-DD-{increasing int:06d}\")\n",
    " - `quotation`: Text of the longest encountered original form of the quotation\n",
    " - `date`: Earliest occurrence date of any version of the quotation\n",
    " - `phase`: Corresponding phase of the data in which the quotation first occurred (A-E)\n",
    " - `probas`: Array representing the probabilities of each speaker having uttered the quotation.\n",
    "      The probabilities across different occurrences of the same quotation are summed for\n",
    "      each distinct candidate speaker and then normalized\n",
    "      - `proba`: Probability for a given speaker\n",
    "      - `speaker`: Most frequent surface form for a given speaker in the articles where the quotation occurred\n",
    " - `speaker`: Selected most likely speaker. This matches the the first speaker entry in `probas`\n",
    " - `qids`: Wikidata IDs of all aliases that match the selected speaker\n",
    " - `numOccurrences`: Number of time this quotation occurs in the articles\n",
    " - `urls`: List of links to the original articles containing the quotation "
