# An analysis of the american political scene from a mediatic point of view 

## Abstract

In the 21st century, media coverage is crucial for political figures.
By studying the number of quotes referred to a given politician on a given date, we can have a rough measure of how much interest the media addressed to the politician that day. Using Quotebank Dataset, we studied the evolution of the number of citations of two of the most famous American politicians (Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton) over the last few years, and we compared it to key events in their careers to present the story of the American political scene of the years 2015-2017 from a mediatic point of view. Moreover, we compared our work with Google Trends to see if the conventional media outlets capture online interest well. Finally, using t-tests, confidence intervals, and an interpretable machine learning model (linear/logistic regression), we understood which features of the authors of the quotes could predict whether the latter will speak about Clinton or Trump.

## Dataset used

* The **Quotebank** (quotes centric version) dataset: Quotebank is a dataset of 235 million unique, speaker-attributed quotations that were extracted from 196 million English news articles (127 million containing quotations) crawled from over 377 thousand web domains (15 thousand root domains) between September 2008 and April 2020. The quotations were extracted and attributed using Quobert, a distantly and minimally supervised end-to-end, language-agnostic framework for quotation attribution.

* **Google trends** timeseries data: used to retrieve the number of searches on different periods of the two main politicians.
